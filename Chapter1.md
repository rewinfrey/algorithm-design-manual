# Chapter 1 -- Introduction to Algorithm Design

Algorithms are procedures for solving a generalized problem. The specific implementations of algorithms are called instances. Instances specify the inputs and outputs (ex. sorting a list).

Algorithm correctness is a separate issue from algorithm efficiency, and is much harder to verify. Formal proofs are the traditional method to show algorithm correctness.
